# Game Design: Samurai Sensei Game

## Overzicht
"Samurai Sensei* is a game in which you, as the Main Character (MC), suffer from amnesia, and through platformer gameplay, you must retrieve your lost memories.

The way this operates is as follows: by engaging in platforming, you progress through new levels and face new challenges. After overcoming a series of rooms, you can discover something that triggers a flashback, allowing you to regain some of your forgotten skills. This, in turn, leads to new levels being unlocked.

The game is developed with the target audience of 16-26-year-olds in mind. It is a skill tree-based story platforming game where we aim to tell the story in a realistic manner while also creating challenging gameplay."

The current game is being made for pc players, but we are also creating controls for a controllers. As the game is a platformer it should work with a controller just as well if not better then it would with a keyboard

## Design Pillars

1. **Accessibility and Approachability**
   - *Description:* Ensure that the game is easy to pick up and accessible to everyone.
   - *Examples:*
     - Keep the surface of the gameplay as simple and intuitive as possible.
     - Gradual introduction of new mechanics, like dashing and wall jumping.
     - Simple UI with as few (intuitive) buttons as possible to get the player into the game quickly.

2. **Engaging and Rewarding Gameplay**
   - *Description:* Create a rewarding experience that encourages players to keep playing.
   - *Examples:*
     - Good movement / character control, so the play feels like they're in control.
     - Feedback for fast room clear speeds / class based room objectives (places that can only be reached by high dash classes for example).
     - Ability to choose their own play style.
     - Unlocking set skills to further their progress and keep the player interested in new upcoming mechanics.

3. **Visual Cohesion**
   - *Description:* Develop a visually appealing and cohesive aesthetic to enhance the gaming experience..
   - *Examples:*
     - Medieval Japan / Edo Period Japan.
     - visual or audio feedback when completing a task or finding a lost memory.
     - Changing effects for unlocking skills and/or stats.

## Core Mechanics

1. **Clear all levels and regain your strength**
   - The main goal of the game is completing the levels so you can regain your memories and, in turn, your strength.
  
2. **Level Progression**
   - The player builds up his/her progression by adding stat points to their build, getting back their memories which in turn grant them skills and moving through the world map with their newly acquired skills and stats.

3. **Completing a level**
   - To complete a level you simply need to move from one side of the screen, to another. In some levels this is easier said then done and in some levels, unless a certain skills is unlocked, this simply cannot be done.

4. **Platform your way through the world to regain your memories**
   - The core of the game is platforming, combined with having a skill tree and stats. The platforming gets increasingly difficult and also changes depending the stats you choose.

## Formal Elements

### 1. Game Mechanics
- **Rules:**
  - Samurai Sensei is a game solely based around platforming, the more you play however, the more skills you get to change the movement and to make places that weren't reachable before, now reachable, being able to reach these places by gaining the skills is a fundamental part because this unlockes new levels to progress the story.

- **Objectives:**
  - The primary goal is to regain al of your memories by collecting mementos that let you regain your skills by means of flashbacks. The way you find these mementos is by having increasingly accurate flashbacks.

- **Feedback:**
  - The player has a distinct visual- and audio effect when they use a skill. The higher a skills rank is, the more flashy the skills are. This all is done to increase the players engagement and make them feel more empowered when using their skills.


### 2. Graphics
- **Visual Style:**
  - The game will be 2d and have visuals of a dated medieval Japanese country, like it's currently in a war and thus the surroundings looks war torn.

- **Character Design:**
  - The character will be a samurai without a current master (ronin) and is looking to regain his lost memories by roaming the world (and following flashbacks?).

- **Environment Design:**
  - Samurai Sensei's visual style is based on a medieval Japanese (1500) / Edo Period (1600 - 1800) timeline and will have some surroundings that looks dated (overgrown with plants, barren land, etc.) and forgotten, but also bustling towns/cities (where the surroundings may still look somewhat dated).


### 3. Sound
- **Music:**
  - The game should have music depending on the surroundings and current action that is being undertaken. If the player is currently in town it should be a lively song, as so are the villagers around them. If, however, the player is in a wilderness all alone while they're platforming, the music should be calming / eery (depending on the visual environment). The game should also have a faster song that is meant to force the player to speed up, or focus more on the task at hand, like getting to an objective on time.

- **Sound Effects:**
  - Sound effects play a significant role in Samurai Sensei, the sounds should correlate to the skills that are used. They should also give feedback based on the stats of the current skill / stat level.


### 4. Story
- **Storyline:**
  - The main character (a samurai, currently without a master) has amnesia and has to find mementos based on the current paths he has open to him and the flashbacks that he is getting while getting closer to the the objective. These objectives can be different items, but are mainly memento's. These different objectives also unlock skills, these regained skills will then open a new way for the samurai to explore and find new memento's/objects.

- **Characters:**
  - The main character is a samurai currently without a master, but before losing his memories, he did have one. The story for our character is based on him finding his master, while searching for him he will acquire the help from former friends of his master and people acquainted to him and his former master. The friends/acquaintices help the young samurai in his journey to find his master.


### 5. User Interface (UI)
- **Menus and HUD:**
  - The UI is designed with accessibility in mind, keeping it simple for easy player adoption. Minimal HUD elements ensure a smooth and seamless experience for the player.

- **Controls:**
  - Controls are optimized for use on a pc, the controls should be intuitive and easy to understand. The game will also have controller controls and will thus also be playable on a controller like the dualshock 4.


### 6. Gameplay
- **Player Interaction:**
  - Player interaction revolves around the use of skills and upgrading stats to interact with the environment differently, meaning that different stats can have different interactions with the platforms in a level.

- **Balance:**
  - Game balance is reflected in level design. Initial screens of levels are predetermined, and falling tiles after layer removal are randomly sorted. To reduce the RNG impact, the game includes an extra turn feature, allowing players a double move when stuck. Levels are predetermined and are to be completed in a set sequence when playing the game, certain parts of the game can't be accessed without the skills required to go further in the levels after.


### 7. Technology
- **Platform:**
  - Elemental Outbreak is exclusively designed as a pc game, aligning with the preferences of the 16-26 age demographic.

- **Performance:**
  - With good code optimization and considering the power of modern pc's and laptops, this game should run smoothly on most systems.


### 8. Level Design
- **Visual:**
  - Level design is consistent, and it's all based on a war torn Medieval Japan, in which the world is barren, but there are also parts of overgrown wilderness.
  

### 9. Social Elements
- **Multiplayer Features:**
  - Currently there are no multiplayer elements next to achievements planned. Possibly a leaderboard based on clear time.
